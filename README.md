# Simplistic R functions for NCBI summary searches

A small set of functions that can be used to query NCBI entrez.

Note that these do not make use of the more sophisticated aspects
of the NCBI web API, but simply parse the data returned by the queries.

I've uploaded these mainly to make it easier for me to use on more
than one computer. I suspect that CRAN or Bioconductor has packages
that have a superset of these functions and which are implemented
more properly.
